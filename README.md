# Image Processing Using DFT, DCT, KL, and SVD Transforms
This project demonstrates various image processing techniques using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Karhunen–Loève (KL) Transform, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The MATLAB script processes a grayscale image and applies the mentioned transformations, displaying the results and partial reconstructions.
